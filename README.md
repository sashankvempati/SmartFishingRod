# Smart Fishing Rod
This is the code for a Smart Fishing Rod that is used to calculate the weight using an Arduino Mega.

### ECE 196 Spring 2023
### Team:

- Sashank Vempati
- Jiawen Yu

## List of sensors and components used:

### Load Cell sensor
The Load Cell sensor is used for calculating the weight exerted on fishing rod. This has proven to be the most reliable sensor for weight calculation compared to a rubber stretch sensor or flex sensor.

### IMU sensor
We used the MPU-6050 to get Accelerometer and Gyroscope data to calculate the angles. This is used to find the optimal angle to hold the fishing rod at.

### Load Cell Amplifier
Amplifies the voltage generated by the Load Cell. The arduino is connected to the amplifier to read the load cell values.

### Pushbutton Switches 
One button is used for resetting and zeroing the weight, and the other is used for saving the current weight.

### RGB LED 
This is used to indicate whether the fishing rod is being held at an optimal angle, and whether the reset and save buttons have successfully worked by flashing in their respective colors (flashes red for reset, and flashes green for save).

### OLED Display
This is the screen we use and updates the weight in real time.
